We now have code review via gerrit at https://gerrit.liqui.org/r/ If
you don't have a password but need one, send email to
rjkroege@chromium.org and one will be provided. Send the crypt-ed,
salted version if you want to keep the plaintext safely obscured.

Once there, sign-in, setup gerrit and add a ssh key. At this point,
you should be able to checkout (via git ssh) the source code and
upload changes via typical gerrit magic.

Prior to using Gerrit, I recommend doing some setup to making it
easier. Review
https://gerrit.liqui.org/r/Documentation/user-upload.html#_git_push
and install a git hook per
https://gerrit.liqui.org/r/Documentation/user-changeid.html to process
using a command something like this:

scp -p -P 29418 <your name>@gerrit.liqui.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/

If configured correctly, working with Gerrit ought to be as simple as:

hack, hack, hack, git rebase to squash, git push repeat.
