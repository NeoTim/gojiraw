This project is Gojiraw -- a convenient abbreviation of "GO JIffy-fast
RAW-draw". Gojiraw is a library and demo program for a deferred (i.e.
display-list based) GPU-accelerated 2D rendering system. The drawing
primitives (a work in progress) are inspired by the Plan9 raster
drawing library and the Blink drawing interface.
