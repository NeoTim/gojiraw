Design notes for Gojiraw go here.

My intent was that design notes are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and use
[CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/spec.php) for comments.
GitHub doesn't however support CriticMarkup. I'll use 
task lists instead.

Reading order:

*  [Introduction](introduction.md)
*  [Basic types](basictypes.md)
*  [Images](images.md)
*  [Inkings](inkings.md)
